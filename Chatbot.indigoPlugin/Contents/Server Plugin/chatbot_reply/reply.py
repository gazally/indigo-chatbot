    other reply patterns and rules.

            - lowercase everything
            - Kill remaining non-alphanumeric characters

        Parameters:
            text - the string to process
            substitutions - a list of (name, func) tuples. Each function will
                be passed the original input string and a list containing lists
                of words derived from the original input string. Each function
                must return a list of lists of words and the outer list must be
                the same length as the input. The functions in the substitutions
                list will all be called, using the output of one as the input of
                the next.

        Examples, showing text and the results placed in raw_words,
        tokenized_words and normalized.

        I'm tired today! ==>  ["I'm", "tired", "today!"],

                              "im tired today"
        Wazzup! :) ==> ["Wazzup!", ":)"]
                       [["wazzup"], [[""]])
                       "wazzup"

        Substitutor methods may change the number of words in the sublists of 
        tokenized_words, but they should not change the number of sublists in
        tokenized_words, or a TypeError will be raised.

        For example, a substitutor that expands contractions might do this:

        I'm tired today! ==>  ["I'm", "tired", "today!"],
                              [["i am"], ["tired"], ["today"]]
                              "i am tired today"

        The reason for the nested lists in tokenized_words is so that the code
        which generates matches can map text matched  in the normalized 
        string back to the original string, so for example if you match
        "I'm tired today!" to the pattern "i am tired _*", the match dict
        entry for "raw_match0" will contain "today!"
